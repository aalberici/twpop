# System Patterns: Porrettana Gomme MDM Integration

## Architecture Overview

The integration solution follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

## Core Components

### 1. Master Data Repository

Centralized storage for all product and pricing data with the following characteristics:
- Normalized data model for product information
- History tracking for changes
- Validation rules for data integrity
- De-duplication mechanisms

### 2. Integration Services

Responsible for data exchange with external systems:
- XML/Flat file importers and exporters
- SQL view-based data access
- Validation and transformation services
- Error handling and logging

### 3. Business Rules Engine

Implements complex business logic for pricing and product management:
- Rule definition framework
- Formula evaluation engine
- Conditional logic processing
- Decision tables for complex scenarios

### 4. Analytics Framework

Supports business intelligence capabilities:
- Data aggregation services
- Reporting templates
- Dashboard components
- Export capabilities

### 5. Security Framework

Ensures secure operations across the system:
- Authentication and authorization
- Secure data transfer
- Audit logging
- Role-based access control

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Repository Pattern

Abstracts data access logic and provides a clean separation between business logic and data access:

<$mermaid text=
'classDiagram
    class BusinessLogic
    class Repository
    class DataAccess
    BusinessLogic --> Repository : Uses
    Repository --> DataAccess : Uses
'></$mermaid>

### 2. Factory Pattern

Provides a standardized way to create complex objects, particularly for product and pricing entities:

<$mermaid text=
'classDiagram
    class Client
    class Factory
    class Product
    Client --> Factory : Requests
    Factory --> Product : Creates
'></$mermaid>

### 3. Observer Pattern

Implements event-driven updates for price changes and catalog updates:

<$mermaid text=
'classDiagram
    class Subject
    class Observer
    class ConcreteObserver
    Subject --> Observer : Notifies
    ConcreteObserver --|> Observer : Implements
'></$mermaid>

### 4. Strategy Pattern

Allows different pricing strategies to be implemented and switched dynamically:

<$mermaid text=
'classDiagram
    class Context
    class Strategy
    class ConcreteStrategy
    Context --> Strategy : Uses
    ConcreteStrategy --|> Strategy : Implements
'></$mermaid>

## Data Flow Patterns

### 1. Product Data Synchronization

<$mermaid text=
'sequenceDiagram
    participant PS as Porrettana System
    participant IL as Integration Layer
    participant MDM as MDM Repository
    PS->>IL: Send Product Updates
    IL->>IL: Transform & Validate
    IL->>MDM: Store Validated Data
    MDM->>IL: Confirmation
    IL->>PS: Update Status
'></$mermaid>

### 2. Price Calculation Flow

<$mermaid text=
'sequenceDiagram
    participant PU as Pricing User
    participant RE as Rules Engine
    participant MDM as MDM Repository
    participant PS as Porrettana System
    PU->>RE: Define Pricing Rules
    RE->>MDM: Retrieve Product Data
    MDM->>RE: Product Data
    RE->>RE: Apply Rules
    RE->>MDM: Store Calculated Prices
    MDM->>PS: Synchronize Price List
'></$mermaid>

### 3. Analytics Data Flow

<$mermaid text=
'sequenceDiagram
    participant PS as Porrettana System
    participant IL as Integration Layer
    participant DW as Data Warehouse
    participant UI as Analytics UI
    PS->>IL: Send Sales/Inventory Data
    IL->>IL: Transform & Aggregate
    IL->>DW: Store Analytics Data
    UI->>DW: Query Data
    DW->>UI: Return Results
'></$mermaid>

## Integration Patterns

### 1. ETL Pattern

Extract, Transform, Load pattern for batch data processing:
- Used for initial data migration
- Scheduled data synchronization
- Bulk price updates

### 2. Message-Based Integration

Event-driven integration for real-time updates:
- Product status changes
- Price updates
- Inventory changes

### 3. Direct Database Access

Secure read-only views for operational data:
- Current inventory levels
- Active price lists
- Product catalog

## Error Handling Patterns

### 1. Circuit Breaker

Prevents cascading failures when external systems are unavailable

### 2. Retry with Exponential Backoff

Handles temporary integration failures with progressively longer waits between retries

### 3. Dead Letter Queue

Stores failed messages for later processing and analysis

### 4. Validation and Error Reporting

Comprehensive validation with detailed error reporting for data quality issues
