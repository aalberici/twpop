# Product Context: Porrettana Gomme MDM Integration

## Business Background

Portettana Gomme Spa is a tire retailer operating multiple locations (Bologna, Pistoia, Silla) in Italy. The company needs to optimize its product catalog management and pricing strategy to remain competitive in the market. The business deals with various tire manufacturers and distributors, managing thousands of product references across different categories.

## Key Business Challenges

### Product Catalog Management
- **Obsolete References**: The current system retains obsolete product references, making it difficult to identify current products
- **Product Duplication**: Same products sometimes appear with different codes (e.g., based on manufacturing location)
- **PreCat vs. Non-PreCat Products**: Some suppliers provide standardized PreCat data, while others only provide Excel sheets
- **Manual Data Entry**: Non-PreCat products require time-consuming manual entry

### Pricing Management
- **Complex Pricing Rules**: Different markup percentages based on product category, vehicle type, and brand
- **Time-Consuming Updates**: Price updates require significant manual effort
- **Limited Flexibility**: Difficult to implement promotional pricing or segment-specific pricing
- **Single Price List**: Currently limited to one primary price list ("Listino 90")

### Business Intelligence
- **Limited Visibility**: Insufficient analytics on sales performance by product category
- **Margin Analysis**: Difficulty tracking margin performance across product lines
- **Inventory Optimization**: Limited tools for inventory analysis and optimization

## User Experience Goals

### Product Managers
- Easy identification and removal of obsolete products
- Simplified product association and cross-referencing
- Automated data import from Excel for non-PreCat products
- Clear visibility into product lifecycle

### Pricing Managers
- Dynamic pricing rules based on multiple criteria
- Batch price updates for specific product segments
- Time-based promotional pricing capabilities
- Price comparison tools for competitive analysis

### Business Analysts
- Comprehensive dashboard for sales and margin analysis
- Ability to identify high-performing product categories
- Tools for inventory optimization
- Support for strategic pricing decisions

## Future Evolution

1. **B2B E-commerce**: Plans to develop a B2B platform for business customers using the MDM as foundation
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Future implementation of customer segment-specific pricing
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Eventually implementing predictive tools for pricing optimization
4. **Cross-Location Inventory**: Enhanced inventory management across multiple locations
